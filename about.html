<p>Founded in 1979, the Sydney branch of the ACFS holds events, helps coordinate Cuban experts to visit Australia, protests the U.S. blockade of Cuba, and supports the work of the Cuban Embassy and the Cuban Institute for Friendship with the Peoples. Our branch, like all solidarity organisations, runs as a result of the work of a core of dedicated people and is also supported by a small but active left media and by various trade unions, especially the CFMEU, CEPU, FBEU, MUA, NSWTF, and the AMWU.</p>

<p>We also promote an annual study trip for Australians and New Zealanders to Cuba called the Southern Cross Brigade.</p>

<p>We also take part in national solidarity activities by coordinating with ACFS branches from other states and cities.</p>

<p>Every year, we join with representatives from groups around the country at the ACFS National Consultation to share ideas on how to promote Cuban solidarity and socialism. Over the years we have been privileged to send delegates to the Regional Conferences of Solidarity with Cuba in Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Laos and the Philippines and to realise the importance Cuba’s solidarity to the countries in our region.</p>

<p>We meet on the first Thursday of every month at 6:30pm at the Teacher’s Federation, Lvl 1 33 Mary St, Surry Hills. Meetings are open to all friends of Cuba and those interested in finding out more about Cuba.</p>
