<p>The Australia Cuba Friendship Society (ACFS) aims to promote solidarity between Cuba and Australia and to support Cuba in achieving its socialist aims and principles.</p>

<p>Our Sydney branch runs as a result of the work of a core of dedicated people and is also supported by a small but active left media and by various trade unions. We are committed to continuing our work of promoting the Cuban revolution in all its facets and supporting demands for the end to the blockade against Cuba, the return of Guantanamo and the inviolability of Cuban sovereignty!</p>
