<p>The Australia-Cuba Friendship Society (ACFS, Sydney Branch) denounces, as an affront to democracy and the rule of law, the ongoing attempt at coup d’etat in Venezuela sponsored by the United States of America. We condemn the Australian Government’s unlawful recognition of self- proclaimed ‘interim president’ Juan Guaidó, who has never been a candidate in an election for president. We condemn equally the irresponsible and unprincipled support for this recognition by the Australian Labor Party.</p>
