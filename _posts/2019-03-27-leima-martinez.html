<p>Dear ACFS members and friends,</p>

<p>This week, we have the pleasure of welcoming to Australia Leima Martinez Freire, the Asia Pacific Director of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with the Peoples (ICAP).</p>

<p>Leima will be attending and participating in two events in Sydney during her visit.</p>

<h3>ACFS PUBLIC MEETING, THURSDAY 4 APRIL</h3>

<p>On Thursday 4 April, she will speak at the Teacher's Federation about life in Cuba, the re-strengthening of US sanctions, and the Cuban Women's Federation's recent 10th Congress. Please join us to hear her speak in English, followed by a QandA.</p>

<h3>CENTRE FOR COUNTER-HEGEMONIC STUDIES LECTURE, THURSDAY 28 MARCH</h3>

<p>Leima will also be meeting people and talking briefly at the Maritime Union of Australia (365 Sussex St Sydney) this Thursday 28 March, at 6pm. </p>

<p>Leima's section will be followed by a talk on the war in Yemen and Australia's role in the arms industry, given by Jay Tharappel. This talk has been organised by the Centre for Counter Hegemonic Studies (with Tim Anderson, Director) and supported by the Maritime Union of Australia, which is a strong supporter of Cuba, with many great internationalists.</p>
